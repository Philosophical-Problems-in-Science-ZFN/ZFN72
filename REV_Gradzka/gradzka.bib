It collects almost all the papers presented at the symposium as well as some additional ones. The contributors include scholars from Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Poland. The papers are devoted to the history and reception of the Lvov-Warsaw School, a Polish branch of analytic philosophy. They present the School’s achievements as well as its connections to other analytic groups. The contributors also show how the tradition of the School is developed contemporarily. The title will appeal to historians of analytic philosophy as well as historians of philosophy in Central Europe.},

@misc{betti_kazimierz_2019,
	title = {Kazimierz {Twardowski}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entrieswardowski/},
	abstract = {Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) was an Austrian-born Polishphilosopher. He was a student of Franz Brentano and the founder of the Lvov-Warsaw School. His main work, On the Content and Object of Presentations(1894), established the need for the distinction between the contentand the object of a presentation within Brentanian theories of theintentionality of mental acts. The distinction is a psychological,non-platonistic counterpart of Frege's distinction between sense andreference. Other students of Brentano, notably Edmund Husserl andAlexius Meinong, integrated the distinction between content and objectin their works after the appearance of Twardowski's book. Twardowskispoke of contradictory objects before Meinong: he was the firstphilosopher to hold a theory of intentionality, truth, and predicationin which thinking and speaking about non-existents, includingcontradictions, involves presenting and naming non-existents,including contradictory objects. Like Meinong, Twardowski belonged toa tradition of non-idealistic German-language philosophy thatoriginated with Bernard Bolzano, and that influenced, via G. F. Stout,Moore and Russell's transition from idealism to analytic philosophy.After moving to Lvov (now Lviv) in 1895, Twardowski devoted himself toestablishing a tradition of scientific, i.e. rigorous and exactphilosophy in Poland inspired by Brentano's views rather than topublishing his own ideas. As a result, his published oeuvre,written in Polish and German, is relatively small. Twardowski'sunpublished manuscripts, often complete sets of lecture notes,constitute a considerable part of his philosophical corpus. Accordingto Roman Ingarden, assessments of Twardowski's achievements and hisrole in history should be considered incomplete and hypothetical aslong as they are based only on his published writings (Ingarden 1948,18). Important projects for the edition and dissemination ofTwardowski's manuscript material have been recently completed or arecurrently ongoing in Austria, France, Poland, Italy, and the Netherlands.[1], Twardowski was a sharp thinker and a writer of exemplary clarity. Hewrote on signs, on meaning and reference, and on indexicality andtruth, defending a non-platonistic view of time-independent truth; hewrote on the metaphysics of parts and wholes, on ethics, on thehistory of philosophy, on the relation between philosophy andpsychology, and, importantly, on metaphilosophy. In Twardowski's timespsychology was divided roughly in two camps: ‘Wundtian’experimental psychology and ‘Brentanian’ descriptivepyschology (see the entries on Wundt and Brentano); although Twardowski sided mainly with Brentano's way of looking atpsychology, he lectured on themes from experimental psychology such asoptical illusion and established the first laboratory of empiricalpsychology in Poland. He developed a judgment-based theory ofknowledge, and he valued analysis as a fruitful method in philosophy.This notwithstanding, it is a widespread convinction that Twardowski'smost tangible success remains his extraordinary work as educator andinitiator of philosophical activities in Poland. Indeed, Twardowskiwas a talented teacher, like Brentano, and he exerted, through histeaching, a powerful influence on generations of young Polishphilosophers, such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz,Stanisław Leśniewski (who, in turn, taught Alfred Tarski)and Tadeusz Kotarbiński. This influence regarded first of allmatters of method: Twardowski laid emphasis on ‘smallphilosophy’, namely on the detailed, systematic analysis ofspecific problems—including problems from the history ofphilosophy—characterised by rigor and clarity, rather than onthe edification of whole philosophical systems and comprehensiveworld-views.},
