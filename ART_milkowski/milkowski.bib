We support our remarks by appealing to empirical evidence from the fields of cognitive science and ethnography. Particular attention is paid to the structure and functioning of a cognitive system, as well as its external representations. We analyze the problem of how far we can push the study of human cognition without taking into account what is underneath an individual’s skin. In light of our discussion, a distinction between DCog and the extended mind becomes important.},

	abstract = {Newell (1980; 1990) proposed that cognitive theories be developed in an effort to satisfy multiple criteria and to avoid theoretical myopia. He provided two overlapping lists of 13 criteria that the human cognitive architecture would have to satisfy in order to be functional. We have distilled these into 12 criteria: flexible behavior, real-time performance, adaptive behavior, vast knowledge base, dynamic behavior, knowledge integration, natural language, learning, development, evolution, and brain realization. There would be greater theoretical progress if we evaluated theories by a broad set of criteria such as these and attended to the weaknesses such evaluations revealed. To illustrate how theories can be evaluated we apply these criteria to both classical connectionism (McClelland \& Rumelhart 1986; Rumelhart \& McClelland 1986b) and the ACT-R theory (Anderson \& Lebiere 1998). The strengths of classical connectionism on this test derive from its intense effort in addressing empirical phenomena in such domains as language and cognitive development. Its weaknesses derive from its failure to acknowledge a symbolic level to thought. In contrast, ACT-R includes both symbolic and subsymbolic components. The strengths of the ACT-R theory derive from its tight integration of the symbolic component with the subsymbolic component. Its weaknesses largely derive from its failure, as yet, to adequately engage in intensive analyses of issues related to certain criteria on Newell's list.},

	abstract = {The paper explores the distinction between two doctrines, both of which inform theory construction in much of modern cognitive psychology: the representational theory of mind and the computational theory of mind. According to the former, propositional attitudes are to be construed as relations that organisms bear to mental representations. According to the latter, mental processes have access only to formal (nonsemantic) properties of the mental representations over which they are defined.
            
              The following claims are defended: (1) That the traditional dispute between “rational” and “naturalistic” psychology is plausibly viewed as an argument about the status of the computational theory of mind. Rational psychologists accept a formality condition on the specification of mental processes; naturalists do not. (2) That to accept the formality condition is to endorse a version of methodological solipsism. (3) That the acceptance of some such condition is warranted, at least for that part of psychology which concerns itself with theories of the mental causation of behavior. This is because: (4) such theories require nontransparent taxonomies of mental states; and (5) nontransparent taxonomies individuate mental states without reference to their semantic properties. Equivalently, (6) nontransparent taxonomies respect the way that the organism represents the object of its propositional attitudes to
              itself
              , and it is this representation which functions in the causation of behavior.
            
            The final section of the paper considers the prospect for a naturalistic psychology: one which defines its generalizations over relations between mental representations and their environmental causes, thus seeking to account for the semantic properties of propositional attitudes. Two related arguments are proposed, both leading to the conclusion that no such research strategy is likely to prove fruitful.},

We then proceed to reinterpret two well-known essays by Bruno Latour, `Visualization and Cognition: Thinking with Eyes and Hands' and `Circulating Reference: Sampling the Soil in the Amazon Forest'. In both cases we find the cognitive and the social merged in a system of distributed cognition without any appeal to agonistic encounters. For us, results do not come to be regarded as veridical because they are widely accepted; they come to be widely accepted because, in the context of an appropriate distributed cognitive system, their apparent veracity can be made evident to anyone with the capacity to understand the workings of the system.},

	title = {Methodological {Individualism}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/methodological-individualism/},
	abstract = {This doctrine was introduced as a methodological precept for thesocial sciences by Max Weber, most importantly in the first chapter ofEconomy and Society (1922). It amounts to the claimthat social phenomena must be explained by showing how they resultfrom individual actions, which in turn must be explained throughreference to the intentional states that motivate the individualactors. It involves, in other words, a commitment to the primacy ofwhat Talcott Parsons would later call “the action frame ofreference” (Parsons 1937: 43–51) in social-scientificexplanation. It is also sometimes described as the claim thatexplanations of “macro” social phenomena must be suppliedwith “micro” foundations, ones that specify anaction-theoretic mechanism (Alexander, 1987)., A contrast is often drawn, following J.W.N. Watkins (1952a), betweenmethodological individualism and methodological holism. This isusually tendentious, since there are very few social scientists whodescribe themselves as methodological holists. There are, however,forms of social-scientific explanation with more active adherents thatmethodological individualism precludes or downgrades. These include,most importantly, functionalism, many types of sociobiology,“memetics” or evolutionary cultural explanation,psychoanalytic and “depth hermeneutic” methods, and anyform of explanatory generalization grounded in purely statisticalanalysis., Defenders of methodological individualism generally claim that it isan innocent doctrine, devoid of any political or ideologicalcontent. Weber himself cautioned that “it is a tremendousmisunderstanding to think that an ‘individualistic’method should involve what is in any conceivable sense anindividualistic system of values” (Weber 1922:18). Nevertheless, the doctrine of methodological individualism becameembroiled in a number of highly politicized debates during the20th century, largely because it was often invoked as a wayof discrediting historical materialism.  There were two distinctrounds of controversy on this score. The first occurred primarilyduring the 1950s, in response to the work of Friedrich von Hayek andKarl Popper. The second round occurred during the 1980s, inresponse to Jon Elster, this time as part of critical debates withinthe movement known as “analytical Marxism.” During thelatter period, methodological individualism became widely associatedwith what many called “rational choice imperialism.”},

It can be applied to cognitive systems at many levels of complexity, from areas of an individual brain to communities of interacting persons. Distributed cognition is sometimes construed as a special kind of cognition that occurs when people are in interaction with one another or with material artifacts. This is only partly correct. Rather than being a kind of cognition, distributed cognition is a manner of thinking about cognition that permits one to examine the relationships between what is in the mind and the world the mind is in. When applied to groups of persons, distributed cognition provides a language for cognitive processes that are distributed across the members of a social group, between people and their material environments, and through time. It attempts to use an understanding of the social, cultural, and material context of cognitive practices to constrain models of cognitive processes within and among individual minds.},

The idea here is that high-level cognition is produced by the culturally orchestrated application of low-level cognitive processes to cultural materials, i.e. elements of language, sign systems, and inscriptions of all sorts. A central claim of distributed cognition is presented and discussed, which posits that the proper unit of analysis for cognition should not be set a priori, but should be responsive to the nature of the phenomena under study here.},

In the 16th century no new man emerged, and no mutants with overgrown brains work in modern laboratories. So one must also reject the Great Divide between the cultures of the scientific and prescientific and replace it with multiple, uncertain and unexpected ‘not-so-great divides’, which can be described in meticulous anthropological studies. Although the achievements of science are certainly spectacular, and the gap between scientific practice and other areas of activity is so obvious, this does not mean that one must look for the “great” reasons behind this situation.},

	abstract = {This is the first presidential address of AAAI, the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. In the grand scheme of history of artificial intelligence (AI), this is surely a minor event. The field this scientific society represents has been thriving for quite some time. No doubt the society itself will make solid contributions to the health of our field. But it is too much to expect a presidential address to have a major impact. So what is the role of the presidential address and what is the significance of the first one? I believe its role is to set a tone, to provide an emphasis. I think the role of the first address is to take a stand about what that tone and emphasis should be-set expectations for future addresses and to communicate to my fellow presidents. Only two foci are really possible for a presidential address: the state of the society or the state of the science. I believe the latter to be correct focus. AAAI itself, its nature and its relationship to the larger society that surrounds it, are surely important. However, our main business is to help AI become a science -- albeit a science with a strong engineering flavor. Thus, though a president's address cannot be narrow or highly technical, it can certainly address a substantive issue. That is what I propose to do.},

	isbn = {978-0-8058-6174-7},
	abstract = {Advances in digital media support a form of inquiry called cognitive ethnography. Cognitive ethnography employs traditional ethnographic methods to build knowledge of a community of practice and then applies this knowledge to the micro-level analysis of specific episodes of activity. The principal aim of cognitive ethnography is to reveal how cognitive activities are accomplished in real-world settings. Cognitive ethnography is a particularly apt method for studying instruction in both formal and informal settings. This paper discusses the practicalities of doing cognitive ethnographic research, including such issues as deciding what to record, selecting data for analysis, re-representing data, and analyzing data. Illustrative examples are provided from a recent cognitive ethnographic study of time-telling instruction.},
