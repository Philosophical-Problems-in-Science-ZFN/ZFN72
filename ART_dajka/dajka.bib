Lett. 111, 240402 (2013)] the authors claim that the photons have discontinuous particle trajectories. Here, we present a neutron optical version of the experiment by Danan et al., where in various beam paths of the interferometer the energy of the neutrons is slightly shifted. This is achieved by using resonance-frequency spin-rotators (SR) operating at different frequencies. The which-way information is derived from the time-dependent intensity, which is considered to result from the interfering cross terms between the stationary main component and the energy-shifted which-way signals. Our statements are based on a simple theoretical model, following the time evolution of the wave function of the neutrons, which clarifies the observation in the framework of standard quantum mechanics and reveals the multifold presence of the neutron’s wave function in the interferometer.},

	abstract = {We consider a finite-dimensional quantum system, making a transition between known initial and final states. The outcomes of several accurate measurements, which could be made in the interim, define virtual paths, each endowed with a probability amplitude. If the measurements are actually made, the paths, which may now be called ``real'', acquire also the probabilities, related to the frequencies, with which a path is seen to be travelled in a series of identical trials. Different sets of measurements, made on the same system, can produce different, or incompatible, statistical ensembles, whose conflicting attributes may, although by no means should, appear ``paradoxical''. We describe in detail the ensembles, resulting from intermediate measurements of mutually commuting, or non-commuting, operators, in terms of the real paths produced. In the same manner, we analyse the Hardy’s and the ``three box'' paradoxes, the photon’s past in an interferometer, the ``quantum Cheshire cat'' experiment, as well as the closely related subject of ``interaction-free measurements''. It is shown that, in all these cases, inaccurate ``weak measurements'' produce no real paths, and yield only limited information about the virtual paths’ probability amplitudes.},

	abstract = {While quantum reality can be probed through measurements, the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF) reveals a subtler reality prevailing between measurements. Under special pre- and post-selections, odd physical values emerge. This unusual picture calls for a deeper study. Instead of the common, wave-based picture of quantum mechanics, we suggest a new, particle-based perspective: Each particle possesses a definite location throughout its evolution, while some of its physical variables (characterized by deterministic operators, some of which obey nonlocal equations of motion) are carried by \&ldquo;mirage particles\&rdquo; accounting for its unique behavior. Within the time interval between pre- and post-selection, the particle gives rise to a horde of such mirage particles, of which some can be negative. What appears to be \&ldquo;no-particle\&rdquo;, known to give rise to interaction-free measurement, is in fact a self-canceling pair of positive and negative mirage particles, which can be momentarily split and cancel out again. Feasible experiments can give empirical evidence for these fleeting phenomena. In this respect, the Heisenberg ontology is shown to be conceptually advantageous compared to the Schr\&ouml;dinger picture. We review several recent advances, discuss their foundational significance and point out possible directions for future research.},

However, as I shall demonstrate, there are also other, weaker effects related to all relevant elements of the setup. In case of the Danan et al. setup, there are even peaks at all frequencies of element oscillations. When confronted in an experiment, these observations shall challenge the interpretation of the experiments based on anomalous trajectories of light.},

Indeed, the weak measurements framework contains only ingredients of the standard quantum formalism, and as such weak measurements are from a technical point of view uncontroversial. However attempting to describe properties of quantum systems through weak values—the output of weak measurements—goes beyond the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics, that relies on eigenvalues. We first recall the usual form of property ascription, based on the eigenstate-eigenvalue link and the existence of ``elements of reality''. We then describe against this backdrop the different meanings that have been given to weak values. We finally argue that weak values can be related to a specific form of property ascription, weaker than the eigenvalues case but still relevant to a partial description of a quantum system.},

The interpretive scheme which results is applicable to closed (isolated) quantum systems, is explicitly independent of the sense of time (i.e., past and future can be interchanged), has no need for wave function ``collapse,'' makes no reference to processes of measurement (though it can be used to analyze such processes), and can be applied to sequences of microscopic or macroscopic events, or both, as long as the mathematical condition of consistency is satisfied. When applied to appropriate macroscopic events it appears to yield the same answers as other interpretative schemes for standard quantum mechanics, though from a different point of view which avoids the conceptual difficulties which are sometimes thought to require reference to conscious observers or classical apparatus.},

The customary kinematic and dynamic rules then allow to construct consistent Boolean logics describing the history of a system, following essentially Griffiths' proposal. Logical implication is defined within these logics, the multiplicity of which reflects the complementary principle. Only one interpretative rule of quantum mechanics is necessary in such a framework. It states that these logics providebona fide foundations for the description of a quantum system and for reasoning about it. One attempts to build up classical physics, including classical logic, on these quantum foundations. The resulting theory of measurement needs not to statea priori that the eigenvalues of an observable have to be the results of individual measurements nor to assume wave packet reduction. Both these properties can be obtained as consequences of the basic rules. One also needs not to postulate that every observable is measurable, even in principle. A proposition calculus is obtained, allowing in principle the replacement of the discussion of problems concerned with the practical interpretation of experiments by due calculations.},

Among these CH is unique in solving the second measurement problem: inferring from the measurement outcome a property of the measured system at a time before the measurement took place, as is done routinely by experimental physicists. The main respect in which CH differs from other quantum interpretations is in allowing multiple stochastic descriptions of a given measurement situation, from which one (or more) can be selected on the basis of its utility. This requires abandoning a principle (termed unicity), central to classical physics, that at any instant of time there is only a single correct description of the world.},

The histories approach in turn gives rise to some conceptual difficulties, in particular the correct choice of a framework (probabilistic sample space) or family of histories, and these are discussed. The central issue is that the principle of unicity, the idea that there is a unique single true description of the world, is incompatible with our current understanding of quantum mechanics.},

	abstract = {The (consistent or decoherent) histories interpretation provides a consistent realistic ontology for quantum mechanics, based on two main ideas. First, a logic (system of reasoning) is employed which is compatible with the Hilbert-space structure of quantum mechanics as understood by von Neumann: quantum properties and their negations correspond to subspaces and their orthogonal complements. It employs a special (single framework) syntactical rule to construct meaningful quantum expressions, quite different from the quantum logic of Birkhoff and von Neumann. Second, quantum time development is treated as an inherently stochastic process under all circumstances, not just when measurements take place. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation provides probabilities, not a deterministic time development of the world. The resulting interpretive framework has no measurement problem and can be used to analyze in quantum terms what is going on before, after, and during physical preparation and measurement processes. In particular, appropriate measurements can reveal quantum properties possessed by the measured system before the measurement took place. There are no mysterious superluminal influences: quantum systems satisfy an appropriate form of Einstein locality. This ontology provides a satisfactory foundation for quantum information theory, since it supplies definite answers as to what the information is about. The formalism of classical (Shannon) information theory applies without change in suitable quantum contexts, and this suggests the way in which quantum information theory extends beyond its classical counterpart.},

Conventional quantum theory relies crucially on ``measurements'' to convert unrealized quantum potentialities into physical outcomes that can be assigned probabilities. In the early universe and other physical contexts in which there are no observers or measuring apparatus (or indeed, in any closed quantum system), what criteria determine which alternative outcomes may be realized and what their probabilities are? In the consistent histories formulation it is the vanishing of interference between the branch wave functions describing alternative histories — as determined by the system’s decoherence functional — that determines which alternatives may be assigned probabilities. We describe the consistent histories formulation and how it may be applied to canonical loop quantum cosmology, describing in detail the application to homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models with scalar matter. We show how the theory may be used to make definite physical predictions in the absence of ``observers''. As an application, we demonstrate how the theory predicts that loop quantum models ``bounce'' from large volume to large volume, while conventional ``Wheeler–DeWitt''-quantized universes are invariably singular. We also briefly indicate the relation to other work.},

In light of this clarification, the raised criticisms of the QCC effect are rebutted.

Another paradoxical phenomenon found within the framework of quantum mechanics is the ‘quantum Cheshire Cat’: if a quantum system is subject to a certain pre- and postselection, it can behave as if a particle and its property are spatially separated. It has been suggested to employ weak measurements in order to explore the Cheshire Cat’s nature. Here we report an experiment in which we send neutrons through a perfect silicon crystal interferometer and perform weak measurements to probe the location of the particle and its magnetic moment. The experimental results suggest that the system behaves as if the neutrons go through one beam path, while their magnetic moment travels along the other.},

It is argued that in spite of recent statistical arguments by Ferrie and Combes, experiments with anomalous weak values provide useful amplification techniques for precision measurements of small effects in many realistic situations. The statistical nature of weak values is questioned. Although measuring weak values requires an ensemble, it is argued that the weak value, similarly to an eigenvalue, is a property of a single pre- and post-selected quantum system.

	abstract = {Is it possible that a measurement of a spin component of a spin-1/2 particle yields the value 100? In 1988 Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman argued that upon pre- and postselection of particular spin states, weakening the coupling of a standard measurement procedure ensures this paradoxical result1. This theoretical prediction, called weak value, was realised in numerous experiments2–9, but its meaning remains very controversial10–19, since its ``anomalous'' nature, i.e., the possibility to exceed the eigenvalue spectrum, as well as its ``quantumness'' are debated20–22. We address these questions by presenting the first experiment measuring anomalous weak values with just a single click, without the need for statistical averaging. The measurement uncertainty is significantly smaller than the gap between the measured weak value and the nearest eigenvalue. Beyond clarifying the meaning of weak values, demonstrating their non-statistical, single-particle nature, this result represents a breakthrough in understanding the foundations of quantum measurement, showing unprecedented measurement capability for further applications of weak values to quantum photonics.},

	abstract = {In this combined theoretical and experimental work, we describe and demonstrate a universal feature of local couplings of spatially preselected and postselected systems. All weak couplings, independently of their physical nature, are modified in the same universal manner, characterized by the weak value of local projection. We present a general analysis which neither relies on a specific form of the coupling nor is restricted to weak interactions. This allows us to define a consistent paradigm of the presence of a quantum particle, much more intricate than the concept of the presence of a classical particle. Furthermore, we discovered that Gaussian pointers remain reliable beyond the weak regime, which enabled a simple and efficient alignment method for interferometric setups.The modification of the effect of interactions of a particle as a function of its preselected and postselected states is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The universality property of this modification in the case of local interactions of a spatially preselected and postselected particle has been found. It allowed us to define an operational approach for the characterization of the presence of a quantum particle in a particular place: the way it modifies the effect of local interactions. The experiment demonstrating this universality property provides an efficient interferometric alignment method, in which the position of the beam on a single detector throughout one phase scan yields all misalignment parameters.},

	abstract = {Here we report a type of dynamic effect that is at the core of the so called ``counterfactual computation'' and especially ``counterfactual communication'' quantum effects that have generated a lot of interest recently. The basic feature of these counterfactual setups is the fact that particles seem to be affected by actions that take place in locations where they never (more precisely, only with infinitesimally small probability) enter. Specifically, the communication/computation takes place without the quantum particles that are supposed to be the information carriers travelling through the communication channel or entering the logic gates of the computer. Here we show that something far more subtle is taking place: It is not necessary for the particle to enter the region where the controlling action takes place; it is enough for the controlled property of the particle, (i.e., the property that is being controlled by actions in the control region), to enter that region. The presence of the controlled property, without the particle itself, is possible via a quantum Cheshire Cat type effect in which a property can be disembodied from the particle that possesses it. At the same time, we generalize the quantum Cheshire Cat effect to dynamical settings, in which the property that is ``disembodied'' from the particle possessing it propagates in space, and leads to a flux of ``disembodied'' conserved quantities.},

	abstract = {Retrocausal models of quantum mechanics add further weight to the conflict between causality and the possible existence of free will. We analyze a simple closed causal loop ensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic time arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other. The loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus forecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law therefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is not revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution is demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the two-state vector formalism, where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been actually made. To quantify this assertion, weak information is described in terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does not exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level, particles can be thought of as weakly interacting according to their past and future states, but causality remains intact as long as the future is masked by quantum indeterminism.Quanta 2016; 5: 53–60.},

We provide a simple and intuitive one-state vector formalism capable of interpreting their experiment. Additionally, we cross-checked our model with a classical-physics-based approach and found that both models are in complete agreement. We argue that the quantity used in the mentioned experiment is not a suitable which-path witness, producing seemingly contraintuitive results. To circumvent this issue, we establish a more reliable which-path witness and show that it yields well-expected outcomes of the experiment.},
