We briefly outline the basic tenets of evolutionary psychology and articulate its meta-theory of the origins of gender similarities and differences. The article then evaluates the specific contributions: Sexual Strategies Theory and the desire for sexual variety; evolved standards of beauty; hypothesized adaptations to ovulation; the appeal of risk taking in human mating; understanding the causes of sexual victimization; and the role of studies of lesbian mate preferences in evaluating the framework of evolutionary psychology. Discussion focuses on the importance of social and cultural context, human behavioral flexibility, and the evidentiary status of specific evolutionary psychological hypotheses. We conclude by examining the potential role of evolutionary psychology in addressing social problems identified by feminist agendas.},

	abstract = {The notion of paternity has been central to theoretical debates about the evolution and organisation of human society. These debates were intensified when it appeared that certain contemporary 'primitives' did not acknowledge paternity. Their procreative beliefs were classified, along with the Virgin Birth, as examples of a widespread theme of supernatural birth. In this article, I argue that it is the anthropologists who have not understood the meaning of paternity and thus have distorted the beliefs of others and obscured the implications of our own. Drawing upon fieldwork in Turkey, I show that paternity has meant begetting; it has meant the primary and creative role, while maternity has meant nurturing and bearing. This 'monogenetic' meaning of paternity is made explicit in Christianity and exemplified by the Virgin Birth but is consistent with the theological concept of monotheism. Similarly the procreative beliefs of the Trobriand Islanders and the Australian Aborigines are consistent with their cosmological beliefs. These are different systems, but both are integrated between intimate and ultimate concerns. Finally, it is asked why paternity has been of such fascination to theorists from the nineteenth century until the present.},

Moreover, from the start Malinowski granted a crucial role to what he claimed to be certain primitive peoples? ignorance of physiological paternity. He could not accept contradiction on this point, as is made particularly clear in his dispute with a colonial administrator named Alex Rentoul.

Comparative features of social living, sexual dimorphism, and reproductive physiology across primate species reveal insights into the natural mating psychology. The extant evidence suggests humans evolved a pluralistic mating repertoire that differs in adaptive ways across sex and temporal context, personal characteristics such as mate value and ovulatory status, and facultative features of culture and local ecology. The chapter addresses the evolutionary psychology of how men and women pursue short-term and long-term mating strategies. Another important question is why an individual man or woman would opt to pursue a long-term strategy versus a short-term strategy. In the future, evolutionary perspectives on human mating strategies should become more fully integrated with other perspectives, including religious, historical, and feminist scholarship.},

Evidence of adaptations to sperm competition in men and women indicates that sperm competition has been a continuous selection pressure during human evolution. The chapter reviews evidence of physiological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms that are most parsimoniously explained as evolutionary responses to sperm competition. Sperm competition can take one of two forms: contest competition, in which rival ejaculates actively interfere with each other's ability to fertilize an ovum or ova, and scramble competition, which is akin to a race or lottery. An interpretation informed by sperm competition theory, however, might argue that the sight of two heterosexual women engaging in sexual behaviors is sexually arousing because it may signal to men that the women are without male partners and, therefore, pose no risk of sperm competition.},
