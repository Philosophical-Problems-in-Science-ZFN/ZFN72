	abstract = {Nozick (1977) was a methodological critique of the Austrian School of economics. He took the view that the praxeological school was guilty of a logical contradiction. On the one hand, it eschews the concept of indiﬀerence. On the other, it utilizes that of supply. But, Nozick argued, for there to be any supply of a good, people must be indiﬀerent to constituent elements of it. Block (1980) attempted to answer Nozick’s criticism, making the point that “supply” is a coherent concept, and people are indeed indiﬀerent to units of which it is comprised, but before human action. During human action, there cannot be any such thing as indiﬀerence, in the technical sense. Machaj (2007) criticizes both Nozick (1997) and Block (1980). The present paper is a response to Machaj (2007).},

Nozick provoked a long debate on the above notions within Austrianism. The aim of this paper is to elaborate such an account of homogeneity that would take the sting out of Nozick’s challenge and allow for non-trivial formulation of the law of diminishing marginal utility. Hence, we shall first take a closer look at the debate on indifference within the Austrian camp, while defending and building upon the Hoppean account vis-à-vis Block’s criticism. Our justification of the Hoppean position shall consist in showing that his account of the correct description of an action is not an ad hoc move aimed at solving just one problem of indifference but is highly intuitive and widely applicable. We conclude by restating the above-mentioned law, thus demonstrating that the Nozickian objection can be successfully replied.},

	abstract = {Why is it that so many efforts by liberals to lift the black underclass not only fail, but often harm the intended beneficiaries' In Please Stop Helping Us, Jason L. Riley examines how well-intentioned welfare programs are in fact holding black Americans back. Minimum-wage laws may lift earnings for people who are already employed, but they price a disproportionate number of blacks out of the labor force. Affirmative action in higher education is intended to address past discrimination, but the result is fewer black college graduates than would otherwise exist. And so it goes with everything from soft-on-crime laws, which make black neighborhoods more dangerous, to policies that limit school choice out of a mistaken belief that charter schools and voucher programs harm the traditional public schools that most low-income students attend. In theory these efforts are intended to help the poor-and poor minorities in particular. In practice they become massive barriers to moving forward. Please Stop Helping Us lays bare these counterproductive results. People of goodwill want to see more black socioeconomic advancement, but in too many instances the current methods and approaches aren't working. Acknowledging this is an important first step},

If we define two resources as serving the same list of ends, then whether these items can be subsumed under the rubric of the “same good” revolves around how we conceive of ends. If ends are at least partly language-dependent, that is, the way of individuating ends depends on the level of generality with which we refer to them, then the notion of the same good seems trivial. In extreme cases, we can specify ends in such a manner that no two items would fall into the-same-good category. Or, we can construe ends so generally that all resources would be conceptualized as the same good for they would serve the same general ends; e.g., of benefitting their owners. After presenting the problem in detail, we study the implication of our construal of ends. We conclude by showing that the triviality objection cannot undermine Austrian subjectivism.},

	abstract = {The supply curve embodies prices and quantities offered for sale of a good. But need each element of this supply be interchangeable? If so, then the person to whom the supply curve applies much necessarily be indifferent among all of these homogeneous components of the supply curve. However, Austrian economists reject the notion of indifference. Must they then jettison one of the most basic elements of economics, the supply curve? In this paper, we aver that the supply curve presupposes the notion of the same good and we approximate ‘the same good’ in steps. First, we delve into the concept of a good as such and only then do we consider what an economic good is, the latter being a proper subset of the former. Eventually, we order the set of economic goods by the relation of sameness, thus arriving at non-overlapping equivalence classes with their respective elements being the same goods. Equipped with this framework, we ultimately try to resist the Nozick’s challenge.},
