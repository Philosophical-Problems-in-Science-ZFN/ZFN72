	abstract = {Austrian economics ‐ the school of thought associated with Carl Menger, Frederick von Weiser, Eugen von Bohm‐Bawerk, and in this century, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Murray N. Rothbard, and Israel Kirzner ‐ is based on a framework of methodological principles and assumptions much at variance with those of traditional or ‘orthodox’ economists. Robert Nozick, in his ‘On Austrian Methodology’, focuses attention on the most fundamental features of this framework, and subjects them to a thoroughgoing and scathing analysis. Singled out for detailed and critical review are: (1) the praxeological concepts of methodological individualism; (2) the claim that economics is an a priori science of human action; (3) the nature of preference and its relation to choice and action; and (4) the assumptions of time‐preference theory. Although Nozick does not consider Austrian views on business cycles, market process analysis, the coordinative and informational effects of the price system, competition, and several other fundamental aspects of praxeology, his criticism strikes at the very root of the praxeological school. This paper attempts to refute each criticism made of the praxeological school by Nozick on a point‐by‐point basis. It thus follows the same pattern as the original paper, and scrutinizes in detail the arguments made by its author.},

	abstract = {It is a pleasure to reply to Caplan’s (1999) critique of Austrian economics. Unlike other such recent reactions this one shows evidence of great familiarity with the Austrian (praxeological) literature, and a deep interest in its analytical foundations. Thus, Caplan correctly identifies the works of Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard as the core of what sets Austrian economics apart from the neoclassical mainstream. And he insightfully relegates the writings of F.A. Hayek and Israel M. Kirzner to an intermediate position between the praxeological and neoclassical approaches. We shall defend this core of Austrian economics against Caplan’s criticisms, and show that, just as in the case of these others, his arrows fall wide of their mark. It is nevertheless instructive to highlight his errors. The benefits are a better understanding of the Austrian School, and greater insight into neoclassical shortcomings. This article follows the outline of Caplan (1999) and is divided into the same four sections as his: first an introduction, second, consumer theory, third, welfare economics, and fourth, a conclusion.},

	issn = {1801-0938},
	abstract = {Nozick (1977) was a methodological critique of the Austrian School of economics. He took the view that the praxeological school was guilty of a logical contradiction. On the one hand, it eschews the concept of indiﬀerence. On the other, it utilizes that of supply. But, Nozick argued, for there to be any supply of a good, people must be indiﬀerent to constituent elements of it. Block (1980) attempted to answer Nozick’s criticism, making the point that “supply” is a coherent concept, and people are indeed indiﬀerent to units of which it is comprised, but before human action. During human action, there cannot be any such thing as indiﬀerence, in the technical sense. Machaj (2007) criticizes both Nozick (1997) and Block (1980). The present paper is a response to Machaj (2007).},

We show that this view is incompatible with decision problems involving equally optimal actions and we examine various attempts to avoid the existence of these decision problems. We argue that attempts to avoid these decision problems are contrary to the causal-realist approach and lead to unnecessary confusion about the nature of choice and indifference. We show that the alternative approach of using non-strict preferences allows indifference to be given a praxeological interpretation and derived directly from non-strict preference relations as a praxeological category. This leads to a sensible approach to economic analysis that is compatible with the causalrealist approach of the Austrian school. This also avoids the attendant problems of the strict preference approach and allows decision problems to be described in accordance with ordinary language.},
